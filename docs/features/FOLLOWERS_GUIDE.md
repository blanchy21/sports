# How to Use the Follow Functionality

## Current Implementation ✅

The follow/unfollow buttons are implemented in the **UserProfileModal** component. Here's how to use them:

### To Follow a User:
1. Click on any user's avatar or username in a post
2. A user profile modal will open
3. Click the "Follow" button in the modal
4. Approve the transaction in Hive Keychain
5. The button will update to "Unfollow"

### To See Your Followers/Following:
Currently, you can see the counts on your profile page at `/profile`.

## What We Need to Add Next 🔨

To make followers/following fully functional, we need:

1. **A Followers/Following List Page** - A dedicated page showing:
   - List of users you're following
   - List of users following you
   - Search functionality to find users
   - Ability to follow/unfollow directly from the list

2. **Clickable Stats** - On your profile page, make the follower/following counts clickable to navigate to these lists

Would you like me to create:
1. A dedicated Followers/Following page with search?
2. A modal that opens with the list of followers/following?
3. Both?

Let me know your preference!
